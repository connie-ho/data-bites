The food is Olive Garden quality at best...the homemade noodles were nothing more than no yolk noodles that can be bought for $1 at Kroger.  Definitely not going back...the only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because we loved our waitress!!!\\nSave your $$$ and go to Moretti's, well worth the inconvenience of driving to Sawmill.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",

      "I love Ethiopian food. I grew up eating it. Healthy saucy mild or spicy it's Delish.  I love the spice to it. Makes you sweat but doesn't feel like eating fire.  I want to taste my food.  I really like this place. The buffet is $9 and well worth it.  I love their azifa salad.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is they always seem to use more cinnamon then I like.

      "Eclipse de Luna is one of my FAVORITE places in Atlanta ! The food never disappoints, service is great, and food comes out quick ! \\n\\nHappy hour special is amazing ! All dishes half price 4-6 and drink specials. Usually it's about 13 each for me and my friends. \\n\\nThe food is fresh, delicious and well worth the price. \\n\\nI recommend the hamburgers, fried green beans, ribs, calamari, ceviche and Brussel sprouts ! The margarita is on point as well !                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2\n",

      "My friends and I were yelping places to eat lunch on a Sunday and saw this one. When my car walked in we noticed how upscale and fancy it seemed and were scared to look at the prices. But lucky they were reasonable and not pricey at all for large portions. We had called ahead of time and and they said there was no wait but my car asked for a table and it took literally 10+ min. for them to put two tables together. My other friends came to join us after we already gave the host the headcount and we still were waiting. The mimosas were $5 (yes!!!) and I got the smoked salmon Benedict which came with potatoes. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and the eggs a perfect combo of runny and soft. I was not a fan of the toast. The edges were all burnt. The mimosas were delicious and refreshing. The cherry in it was a different touch since it's usually served with a berry but it didn't make a huge difference to me. I would definitely come back again to try other menu items. I loved the smoky woody smells from the cut logs and open kitchen and the restaurant itself was gorgeous, from the black accented tables to the outside with the balcony.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
      "I come here for lunch on my lunch break from work and I can say their food is cooked when you order it. It comes out hot and ready. Their wings are too die for and I really mean that.

      "I went to Chez Vincent with a party of 8 and had one of the worst dining experiences I've had in years.  The food was mediocre at best, the management was arrogant and condescending, but the waiter service was good (she was doing her best given the complete lack of support by her management).\\n\\nJust to be clear through this whole story, the waiter service (I can't remember her name, she was French) was as perfect as it could be given the circumstances.  She did her absolute best even though her management completely unprepared for the evening.\\n\\nWe went during Magical Dining month, so we did expect the restaurant to be busier than usual, so we had reservations for 8.  When we arrived, it was much less busy than expected.  We were seated immediately.  Great!  That's where the fun ended.\\n\\nWe were informed that there was a rehearsal dinner taking place at Hannibal's on the Square (apparently owned by Chez Vincent owners) and that the kitchen was backed up.  Not a big deal I thought, we'll have more drinks, however \"backed up\" was the understatement of the night.  It took over an hour after ordering to get our appetizer.  Another hour after that to get our main course.  After my friend and I were fed up, we made our issues known to the manager.  His response was \"Well, we do have a rehearsal dinner going, but as you can see, this place is very popular\".  Typed words do no justice to the level of condescension in his voice.\\n\\nI am not concerned with how popular your restaurant is.  You as the manager should have known that you're completely incapable of handling the wedding party and standard dinner service at the same time, but instead you tried to make a few extra bucks.  The lack of experience showed.\\n\\nSo another 30 minutes has past since the main meal (that's 2.5 hours now since we've ordered) while we're waiting for the dessert, and that was enough.  We said, forget it, give us the check.  We're done.  The check was the only thing that was done with any punctuality.\\n\\n\\nBut you're saying, maybe the food makes up for that, right?  No.  No it does not.  It was bland, very boring in both presentation and creativity, and had seemingly very little effort.  I had a pork tenderloin, steamed vegetables, and mashed potatoes.  That's a very simple meal that I didn't expect a world of flavor out of, but it somehow made me think of a frozen meal.  The meat was lukewarm and bland.  The steams veggies were alright, not great. And the mashed potatoes had chunks and was flat out cold.  As in, stuck in the fridge cold.\\n\\nThe summation, I will not be going back, ever.  I brought a group of out of town friends here and it ruined the entire night through the poor service but also since we wasted 3 hours of our night here.    1\n",
      "Time to update my 4 to a 5. Actually, the chicken fat griddle bread pudding with bacon on top beat out the poundcake in my book, but delicious. What keeps me coming back is wanting to try all the new options. Delicious! \\n\\nLove that they did a Thanksgiving menu for small and large parties alike.\\n\\nI'm so glad they cater too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    1\n",
